  <short_description>Boot a custom firmware file</short_description>
  <long_description>This program uses the IOSU exploit to boot a custom firmware (CFW) from the SD card.

The file must be placed on the root of the sd card, in sd:/fw.img

This release was the culmination of the effort of some very talented people, who were able to piece this together using public information on the WiiuBru forums.
