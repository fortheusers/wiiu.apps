  <short_description>Control your computer from the Wii U!</short_description>
  <long_description>This app let you send input from the Gamepad to your computer 
  trough the network.
  
  To make it work you'll need to run a client on your computer which you can find
  at the release page: goo.gl/7cvSSf
  
  Currently the client only runs on windows and you cannot configure input :(
  Also screen streaming will most likely never be done because of the brandwidth
  it would require (?)
