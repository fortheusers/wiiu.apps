	<short_description>Shuts down your console</short_description>
	<long_description>This is probably the most pointless app ever made.
Maybe more pointless than that IOSU reboot example.
All it does is shut down your console. That's it.

This is dedicated to *that one person who can't seem to be screwed pressing the POWER button on his/her console/controller*.
