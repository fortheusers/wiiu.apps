    Like SonyUSA, i made my first homebrew (and like her, i'm a beginner in c so be indulgent).

This is a simple Snake game. I don't explain you the rules, everybody knows them.

	  The drawing function in libwiiu is so greedy that you may experience some slowdowns if the snake tail becomes too long.
